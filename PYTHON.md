# Python

## Introduction

Like JavaScript, Python:
* is an interpreted language
* is dynamically typed

Unlike JavaScript, Python:
* uses whitespace indentation. No more semi-colons!
* is strongly typed. If operations are attempted on values of the wrong type, it will throw an error instead of trying to coerce types.
