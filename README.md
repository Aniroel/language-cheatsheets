## About this repo

This repo is designed to help turbo-boost your fluency in a new language by providing you with a cheatsheet of basic syntax and commonly used methods. In other words, it gets you from zero to coding algorithms problems such as those on [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com), as painlessly as possible.

This repo is **not** designed to be an advanced dive into any of these languages.

## How to use this repo

The most efficient and effective way to learn the material in this repo will be to start coding in your new language, and then using this as a reference every time you come across something you don't know how to do. We've tried to make it as convenient as possible, by organizing useful items by data type (e.g. strings, arrays, hash maps).

So open up your favorite algorithms problems site, and dive right in!
